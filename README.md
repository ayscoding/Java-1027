# CS 2210 - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains assignments completed during the **CS 2210 - Data Structures and Algorithms** course. Each assignment is designed to explore core concepts of data structures and algorithms, implementing real-world solutions in Java. The course emphasizes the design, analysis, and implementation of efficient algorithms and data structures, providing a strong foundation for solving complex computational problems.

## Course Description

**CS 2210** is an intermediate-level course that covers fundamental and advanced topics in data structures and algorithms. The course focuses on:

- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**: Understanding and implementing ADTs such as lists, stacks, queues, dictionaries, and priority queues.
- **Data Structures**:
  - Arrays and Linked Lists
  - Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Heaps, etc.)
  - Graphs (Representation, Traversal, and Applications)
  - Hash Tables and Hashing Techniques
- **Algorithm Design and Analysis**:
  - Sorting and Searching Algorithms
  - Recursion and Divide-and-Conquer Techniques
  - Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Shortest Path, and Minimum Spanning Trees)
  - Optimization Techniques
- **Applications**:
  - Maze Solving
  - Game Strategies
  - Multimedia and File Organization

The course emphasizes efficient algorithm design, asymptotic analysis (Big-O, Big-Theta), and the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms.

## Assignments

The assignments completed in this course demonstrate the practical application of theoretical concepts. Below is a summary of the key assignments:

### 1. **Hash Dictionary Implementation**
- Implemented a hash table using separate chaining.
- Stored and retrieved board configurations for a Tic-Tac-Toe game to optimize gameplay.

### 2. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Ordered Dictionary**
- Developed an ordered dictionary using a Binary Search Tree.
- Implemented operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal for efficient data management.

### 3. **Maze Solver Using Graph Representation**
- Represented a maze as an undirected graph.
- Solved the maze using a modified Depth-First Search (DFS), respecting constraints on available coins for opening doors.

### 4. **Other Projects and Exercises**
- Additional small-scale exercises and projects focusing on algorithm efficiency, recursive problem solving, and graph traversal techniques.
